#Question

You will be given a set of string called  T={T1,T2,....,Tk}  and another string called  P . You will have to find the number of occurrences of  P  in  T . And to do that, you will have to build a string matching automaton. The strings will contain only small letters from the English alphabet from  a  to  z . If the length of the pattern  P  is  m , then your automaton will have  m+1  state labelled by  0,1,2,.....,m . Each of these states will have  26  state transitions.

1. Create an  (m+1)Ã—26  state transition table. ( coding )
2. Feed the strings  Ti  to the automaton and see how many times  P  occur in  Ti  for all  i . ( coding )
3. Compute the total time and space complexity for your solution in terms of  n,m,k  given that the maximum length of a string in  T  is  n . ( complexity analysis )

Submission form will be given below in due time.
You can use any of the three languages from JAVA, C++, Python.
